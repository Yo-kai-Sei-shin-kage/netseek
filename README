## netseek ##
Discover live clients/hosts in an IP range on LAN or WAN.

#Installation
1.) git clone https://github.com/yo-kai-sei-shin-kage/netseek.git
2.) cd netseek
3.) chmod +x install.sh
4.) sudo ./install.sh

## Usage ##
netseek is used as a common command line tool in bash. Use 'netseek' as the command.
Use the first 3 octals of the network address you want to ping scan. Enter a number
between 1 and 255 to set the number of clients/hosts to attempt to discover.

(example@linux:~$ netseek 192.168.1 255)
This^ example will send a single ICMP echo request to:

1.) 192.168.1.1
2.) 192.168.1.2
3.) 192.168.1.3
4.) 192.168.1.4
...
255.) 192.168.1.255

## Disclaimer ##
This tool utilizes the common ping command in a unique way. As it is using ping, this
means clients/hosts will be discovered based upon ICMP echo requests. The ping command
used will incorporate the smallest byte size available in ping (16 bytes) and will only
send a single ping request (to prevent alarming any IDS). Most all devices will respond
to ICMP echo requests by default as it is the most common protocol used to see if a
client/host is up on the network and is responding to other clients/hosts. Some devices
on networks are configured to ignore or not respond to ICMP echo requests above a certain
size or altogether. In these cases, netseek may fail to discover a client/host. netseek
also ignores any ping responses that have any percentage of packet loss (i.e. 1-99% packet
loss). This can be changed within the script if need be.

This tool is offered to the public in the hopes that it will be useful in some way.
