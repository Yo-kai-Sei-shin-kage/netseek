#netseek
Discover live clients/hosts in an IP range on LAN or WAN.

#Installation
1.) Save the file 'netseek' to '/usr/bin/' directory.
2.) Make netseek executable 'chmod +x /usr/bin/netseek'

#Usage
netseek is used as a common command line tool in bash. Use 'netseek' as the command. Use the first 3 octals of the network
address you want to ping scan. Enter a number between 1 and 255 to set the number of clients/hosts to attempt to discover.

(example@linux:~$ netseek 192.168.1 255)
This^ example will send a single ICMP echo request to:

1.) 192.168.1.1
2.) 192.168.1.2
3.) 192.168.1.3
4.) 192.168.1.4
...
255.) 192.168.1.255

#Disclaimer
This tool utilizes the common ping command in a unique way. As it is using ping, this means clients/hosts will be discovered
based upon ICMP echo requests. The ping command used will incorporate the smallest byte size available in ping (16 bytes) and
will only send a single ping request (to prevent alarming any IDS). Most all devices will respond to ICMP echo requests by
default as it is the most common protocol used to see if a client/host is up on the network and is responding to other
clients/hosts. Some devices on networks are configured to ignore or not respond to ICMP echo requests above a certain size or
altogether. In these cases, netseek may fail to discover a client/host. netseek also ignores any ping responses that have any
percentage of packet loss (i.e. 1-99% packet loss). This can be changed within the script if need be.

This tool is offered to the public in the hopes that it will be useful in some way.
